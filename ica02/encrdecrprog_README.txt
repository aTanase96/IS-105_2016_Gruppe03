Genericrypter starts by allowing you three choices:
you can encrypt to hexadecimal from ascii.
you can decrypt from ascii to hexadecimal.
you can exit the program.

Choosing encryption gives you the option of inputting what you want to encrypt to hexadecimal by writing ascii,
pressing enter after getting the results will send you back to the main menu.

choosing decryption will allow you to input hexadecimal and convert it to ascii, pressing enter after the result will send you to the main menu.

Exit is just exitting the program..
